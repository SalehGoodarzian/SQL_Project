In this github page (https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Learn-SQL), I found some great exercises to do for educational purposes. This gentleman also has a great video on youtube on sql tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3qvj9hO_Bo&list=LL&index=3) which I recommend checking out. I have learned from this great video and attempted the exercises (data is also given in this page). 


In exercises.sql file above, you can find how I wrote codes to answer the exercises
